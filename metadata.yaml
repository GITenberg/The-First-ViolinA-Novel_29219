description: May Wedderburn is living a quiet, dull life in a small town in England
  with her family of two sisters and their parents.  A local landowner is attracted
  to May and offers  to marry her, but she refuses.  At this point, her sister Adelaide  points
  out that their inheritance will not be enough for the three to live in any comfort,
  so since her "fortune is her face", May was foolish to turn down Sir Peter.  At
  this point, Sir Peter's former sister in law offers to take may to Germany where
  her face and her musical talent quickly gain her admission to a world of music and
  excitement
